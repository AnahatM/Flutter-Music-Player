# Minimalist Music Player

A modern music player mobile app made using Flutter, featuring a minimalist, neuromorphic UI.
Features include selecting songs from playlists, and audio playback controls for play, pause, skip next, or skip to previous.
You can also drag the progress bar to seek to a specific point in the song. The app can switch between light and dark mode in the settings page.
